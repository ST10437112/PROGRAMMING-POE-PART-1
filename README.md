This project is a modular login system developed using Java Swing in NetBeans, designed to validate South African cell numbers and enforce secure username and password rules. The interface features a clean blue-themed GUI, with intuitive input fields and real-time validation feedback. The system includes a registration form where users can enter their details, and a login form that authenticates credentials against stored data. All components are organized using external class files to promote reusability and maintainability.
Key functionalities include input validation for usernames (minimum length, no special characters), password strength checks (uppercase, lowercase, digit, and symbol requirements), and cell number formatting specific to South African standards. The system uses switch-case logic for handling user roles and access levels, ensuring that different user types (e.g., admin, guest) are routed appropriately. Error messages and success prompts are displayed using dialog boxes for enhanced user experience. The project also includes basic exception handling to prevent crashes from invalid input.
The codebase follows best practices in modular design, separating UI logic from validation and data handling. SmartArt diagrams and class diagrams were used during planning to visualize system structure and relationships. This project was part of a broader academic assignment focused on system modeling and user interface design, and it demonstrates proficiency in Java, GUI development, and user-centric validation techniques. Future improvements could include database integration, encryption for stored credentials, and multi-user session handling
